Please redesign my current commerce agent web app interface with the following detailed requirements to achieve a professional, premium, futuristic look while keeping the dark AI vibe:

🎨 Overall Theme
✅ Maintain a dark theme with #0B0B0C as the base background.
✅ Introduce slight gradients or tonal variations to avoid a flat black void.
✅ Use electric blue (#00B4FF) as the primary accent for highlights, glows, and microinteractions.

🗂️ Layout Structure
✅ Sidebar:

Keep it fixed and minimalistic with evenly spaced icons.

Add subtle glowing hover effects for each icon to indicate interactivity.

✅ Top Bar:

Include a thin, elegant top bar with the app name/logo on the left and user avatar or settings on the right.

Use a faint bottom shadow or border to separate it from the chat area.

✅ Chat Interface:

Centered with generous padding on left and right for a focused feel.

Chat bubbles/cards with rounded corners (xl) and soft shadows or inner glows to add depth.

Typing indicator with animated dots for agent responses.

✅ Cards (Food Ordering, Travel Planning, Marketplace):

Enhance with:

Slight inner gradients for glassy look

Soft drop shadows (electric blue with 20% opacity)

Larger icons for clear recognition

Bolder titles with clear spacing from descriptions.

✨ Microinteractions & Animations
✅ Smooth fade-in or slide-up animations for cards and messages.
✅ Typing animation effect for agent introduction text (simulate cursor typing).
✅ Hover glows on buttons and interactive elements.

🔤 Typography
✅ Use Inter or Helvetica, with 3 clear size tiers:

Large headings (e.g. agent greeting)

Medium for card titles and prompts

Small for descriptions and supporting text

💡 Additional Vibe Enhancements
✅ Add a floating circular agent avatar with a subtle glow pulse to indicate presence.
✅ Include faint ambient lighting or particle effects in the background for immersive feel (optional, ensure performance friendly).

🎯 Goal
Transform the UI into a luxurious, clean, immersive agent interface that feels premium and fast, retaining the dark AI vibe but elevating the visual and emotional experience for users.
